Version 1.0


Usage: 
Push the button located on the header to add books to the library. Upon pressing the button, you have to fill out a form and add the book to the library, and the book will appear right below the header into the library. 

You can click on any book in the library to open the cover page, to see the information about the book. You can change the status of the boook to "read" or "not-read", also you can remove the selected book from the library.

I got the inspiration for the buttons from Josh Comeau, you can find the whole process in his website:

Also the design of the library I got it from Clairoux Studio:
